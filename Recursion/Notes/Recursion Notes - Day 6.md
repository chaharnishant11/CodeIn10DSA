### Subsets

****

**Approach :** Similar to subsequences, Subsets also utilize take & not take conditions (inclusion and exclusion) and has a branched non-linear tree structure

We need to take care of 3 main things :

- Current array

- Temporary array

- Index, i

Total number of subsets = 2<sup>n</sup> (because at each stage we had 2 choices take & not-take)
