### **Functions**
---

- It is a piece of code that takes some input and produces some output.
- It is useful when we want to do a particular calculation/processing multiple times in  a program, using functions for such tasks.
- This reduces the amount of lines of code we need to write & Prevents our code from becoming unnecessarily bulky.
- Functions also enhance readability.
- Inconsistency will occur if we want some change but don't do it at all places
