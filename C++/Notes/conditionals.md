### **Conditionals**

---

Conditionals refer to if-else and switch
these are used to choose between multiple options, just like in real life we many times have to choose between multiple options, based on the condition we are in
if-else and switch do the similar thing but in code
Some examples of such problems can be program to check eligibility to vote based on age, FizzBuzz problem
FizzBuzz is a problem in which we print Fizz if number is divisible by 3 and print Buzz if its divisible by 5

**If-else Syntax**
`if (Condition){    `
`----Thing to do----`
`} else {           `
`--Else what to do--`
`}                  `

**Switch Syntax**
`switch(expression){`
`case const1:       `
`---things to do----`
`   break;          `
`case const2:       `
`---things to do----`
`   break;          `
`default:           `
`   break;          `
`}                  `

switch case is more cleaner, but mostly people prefer using if-else
