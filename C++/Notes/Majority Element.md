### **Majority Element**
---

**Approaches :**
1. Traverse the whole array and count each elements occurrence, if it exceeds n/2 times then it is majority element. (Time complexity O(N))
2. Frequency array or map (roughly similar to dictionary for python users) (Similar time complexity but uses more space)
3. Moore's Voting Algorithm
