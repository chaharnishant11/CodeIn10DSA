### **Data-Types in C++**

---



**3 Types of Data-types in C++ :**

1. Primary : these are predefined data-types that can be used directly (Example : int,void,floating point,double floating point,Boolean,character)
2. Derived : these data types or data structures that are derived from the basic data types (Example : Function, Array, Pointer, Reference)
3. User Defined : These are the data types that are created by the user and are not pre defined (Example : Class, Structure, Union, Enum, Typedef)



Data-types are used to store/save variables or constants

Variable is something whose value can be changed in future

Constants are those values that can not be changed later on

Whenever we declare/initialize a variable we use the following syntax
`data_type variable_name = value ; `
or 
`data_type variable_name ; `
`variable_name = value ; `

To store multiple such values we don't create tens or hundreds or new variables, instead we make use of arrays, which is a derived data-type/data structure and is used to store multiple values linearly in contiguous location
