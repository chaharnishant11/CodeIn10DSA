### Backtracking Intro - 1

Backtracking is created using recursion but has a few more conditions

In this we explore all possible paths just like recursion & wherever the condition wasn't satisfied we just backtracked

So the main difference between recursion and backtracking is that in recursion we find all solutions and in backtracking we find all solution except the ones that are not favorable for us

**4 Main Questions of Backtracking**

1. Combination Sum

2. Rat in the Maze

3. N Queens

4. Sudoku Solver

Apart from this, we use recursion in sorting also, in case of merge & quick sort
